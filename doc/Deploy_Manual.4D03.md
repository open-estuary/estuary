<h2 id="1">Introduction</h2>

This documentation describes how to get, build, deploy and bring up target system based Estuary Project, it will help you to make your Estuary Environment setup from ZERO.

All following sections will take the D03 board as example, other boards have the similar steps to do, for more detail difference between them, please refer to Hardware Boards sections in http://open-estuary.com/hardware-boards/.

<h2 id="2">Preparation</h2>

<h3 id="2.1">Prerequisite</h3>

Local network: To connect hardware boards and host machine, so that they can communicate each other.

Serial cable: To connect hardware board’s serial port to host machine, so that you can access the target board’s UART in host machine.

<h3 id="2.2">Check the hardware board</h3>

Hardware board should be ready and checked carefully to make sure it is available, more detail information about different hardware board, please refer to http://open-estuary.org/d03/.

<h3 id="2.3">Upgrade UEFI and trust firmware</h3>

You can upgrade UEFI and trust firmare yourself based on FTP service, but this is not necessary. If you really want to do it, please refer to [UEFI_Manual.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/UEFI_Manual.4D03.md).

<h3 id="2.4">Upgrade DTB file(Necessary step) </h3>

Because this dtb file is important to this D03 boards, firstly you must flash this DTB file
into spiflash before any methods of bringing up systerm. Boot D03 to UEFI SHELL, and type the
follow commands in EBL:

We will often do some commands in UEFI EBL shell for these methods, about how to enter it,please refer to [UEFI_Manual.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/UEFI_Manual.4D03.md).

1. IP address config (Optional, you can ignore this step if DHCP works well)
the newest edk2 base code does not support the ifconfig command in "ebl", if we must set the IP address, we have to change to "shell" (EFI Internal Shell)
  ```
 # Config board's IP address
 ifconfig -s eth0 static <IP address> <mask> <gateway> 
   ```
  e.g.: 
  
  `ifconfig -s eth0 static 192.168.1.4 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1`

2. Download dtb file from FTP
   ```
   # Download file from FTP server to target board's RAM
   provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <dtb file> -a <download target address>
   # Write data into FLASH
   spiwfmem <source address> <target address> <data length>
   ```
   e.g.:
   ```
   provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f hip06-d03.dtb -a 100000
   sfcerase 0x7C0000 0x10000
   sfcwrite 0x100000 0x7C0000 0x10000
   ```
3. Reboot your D03 board

   You must reboot your D03 board after above two steps, this new DTB file will be used on booting board.

   Note: It is necessary to flash the DTB file to spiflash to solve a known MAC address duplicate Issue.Also it is to be noted that the DTB file should not be input in the Grub config file. So if you wish to use a modified DTB file, then you should always have it flashed to spiflash before bootup.

<h2 id="3">Bring up System</h2>

There are several methods to bring up system, you can select following anyone fitting you to boot up.

<h3 id="3.1">Boot via ESL</h3>

In this boot mode, the kernel image, dtb file and rootfs file should be downloaded into
RAM at first and then start the system by ESL.
After reboot or power off, all downloaded data will be lost.
This boot mode is just used for debugging.

Boot D03 to UEFI menu. Select "Boot Manager"->"Eebedded Boot Loader(EBL)" and type the
follow commands in EBL:

1. Download Image binary file from FTP server to target board's RAM
   ```
    # Download Image binary file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <Image binary file> -a <download target address>
   ```
    e.g.: 
    `provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f Image_D03 -a 0x80000`
 
2. Download dtb file from FTP server to target board's RAM
   ```
   # Download dtb file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <dtb file> -a <download target address>
     ```
   e.g.: 
    `provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f hip06-d03.dtb -a 0x06000000`
 
3. Download rootfs file from FTP server
    ```
    # Download rootfs file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <rootfs file> -a <download target address>
     ```
     e.g.:
  
    `provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f mini-rootfs-arm64.cpio.gz -a 0x07000000`
 
4. Start operator system
  
  Type "exit" to exit EBL. Select "Boot Manager"->"ESL Start OS" menu to start operator system.

<h3 id="3.2">Boot via PXE</h3>

In this boot mode, the UEFI will get grub from PXE server.The grub will get the configuration file from TFTP service configured by PXE server.

1. Setup PXE environment on host

   Enable both DHCP and TFTP services on one of your host machines according to [Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.4All.md).
   
2. Reboot and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI Boot Menu

3. Select boot option "Boot Manager"->"EFI Network" boot option and press "Enter".

4. After several seconds, D03 will boot by PXE automatically.

To config the grub.cfg to support PXE boot, please refer to  [Grub_Manual.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Grub_Manual.4All.md).

<h3 id="3.3">Boot via NFS</h3>

In this boot mode, the root parameter in grub.cfg menuentry will set to /dev/nfs and nfsroot will be set to the path of rootfs on NFS server. You can use `"showmount -e <server ip address>" `to list the exported NFS directories on the NFS server.
 
D03 supports booting via NFS, you can try it as following steps:

1. Enable DHCP, TFTP and NFS service according to [Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.4All.md).

2. Get and config grub file to support NFS boot according to [Grub_Manual.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Grub_Manual.4All.md).

3. Reboot D03 and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI Boot Menu

4. Select boot option "Boot Manager"->"EFI Network" boot option to enter.

<h3 id="3.4">Boot via DISK(SAS/USB/SATA)</h3>

D03 board supports booting via SAS, USB and SATA by default. The UEFI will directly get the grub from the EFI system partition on the hard disk. The grub will load the grub configuration file from the EFI system partition. So grubaa64.efi, grub.cfg, Image and different estuary release distributions are stored on disk.

1. Boot by PXE (please refer to "Boot via PXE") to part and format hardware disk before booting D03 board

   Format hardware disk, e.g.: `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1`; `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2`<br>
   Part hardware disk with `"sudo fdisk /dev/sda"` as follow:<br>
    add a gpt to this disk : 
       
      `fdisk /dev/sda` 
        
      `g`-------add a gpt partition
       
     add some EFI partition : 
       
      `n`-------add a partition
       
      `1`-------the number of partition
       
      `+200M`---------size of partition
       
      `t`-------change the type of partition
       
       EFI system
      
       add some anther partition  `...`<br>
       save the change           : `w`<br>
       formate EFI partition  : `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1`<br>
       formate ext4 partition : `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2`<br>
       
       ```
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | Name    |   Size    |    Type      |   USB/SAS/SATA   |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | sda1    |   200M    |  EFI system  |   EFI            |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | sda2    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | sda3    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | sda4    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
          | sda5    |rest space |    ext4      | linux swap       |
          +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
       ```
        
   Note: EFI partition must be a fat filesystem, so you should format sda1 with `“sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1″`.

2. Download files and store them into hardware disk as below.

  （SAS/USB/SATA）Related files are placed as follow: 
   ```
       sda1: -------EFI
              |       |
              |       GRUB2------grubaa64.efi  //grub binary file
              |
              |-------------grub.cfg           //grub config file
              |
              |-------------Image_D03          //kernel binary Image
        sda2: Ubuntu distribution
        sda3: Fedora distribution
   ```     
    To get kernel image and dtb file, please refer to [Readme.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Readme.4D03.md).<br>
    To get and config grub and grub.cfg, please refer to [Grub_Manual.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Grub_Manual.4All.md).<br>
    To get different distributions, please refer to [Distributions_Guider](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Distributions_Guide.4All.md).<br> 
    
3. Boot the board via SAS/USB/SATA

   a. Modify grub config file(please refer to [Grub_Manual.4All.md](https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Grub_Manual.4All.md))<br>
       e.g.: <br>
       the context of grub.cfg file is modified as follow:
       ``` 
        #
	        # Sample GRUB configuration file
	        #
	        # Boot automatically after 5 secs.
	        set timeout=5
	        # By default, boot the Estuary with Ubuntu filesystem
	        set default=ubuntu
	        # For booting GNU/Linux

           menuentry "ubuntu" --id ubuntu {
           search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root <UUID>
           linux /Image_D03 rdinit=/init root=PARTUUID=<PARTUUID> rootwait rootfstype=ext4 rw console=ttyS1,115200 earlycon=hisilpcuart,mmio,0xa01b0000,0,0x2f8 ip=dhcp
            }
       ```
       Note:<br>
	* `<UUID> `means the UUID of that partition which your EFI System is located in.<br>
          `<PARTUUID>` means the PARTUUID of that partition which your linux distribution is located in. <br>
           To see the values of UUID and PARTUUID, please use the command:$blkid.<br>
	* If you want to use another linux distribution, please refer above steps.
            
  b. Reboot and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI menu.

  c. For USB: Select "Boot Manager"-> "EFI USB Device"-> to enter grub selection menu.<br>For SAS/SATA: Select "Boot Manager"-> "EFI Misc Device 1" to enter grub selection menu.
  
  d. Press arrow key up or down to select grub boot option to decide which distribution should boot.
