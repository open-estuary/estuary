### Introduction ###

This documentation describes how to get, build, deploy and bring up target system based Estuary Project, it will help you to make your Estuary Environment setup from ZERO.

All following sections will take the D03 board as example, other boards have the similar steps to do, for more detail difference between them, please refer to Hardware Boards sections in http://open-estuary.com/hardware-boards/.
 
### Preparation ###

# Prerequisite

    Local network: To connect hardware boards and host machine, so that they can communicate each other.
    
    Serial cable: To connect hardware board’s serial port to host machine, so that you can access the target board’s UART in host machine.

# Check the hardware board

    Hardware board should be ready and checked carefully to make sure it is available, more detail information about different hardware board, please refer to http://open-estuary.com/d03-2/.

# Upgrade UEFI and trust firmware

    You can upgrade UEFI and trust firmare yourself based on FTP service, but this is not necessary. If you really want to do it, please refer to UEFI_Manual.txt.

# Upgrade DTB file (Necessary step) 

   Because this dtb file is important to this D03 boards, firstly you must flash this DTB file
   into spiflash before any methods of bringing up systerm. Boot D03 to UEFI SHELL, and type the
   follow commands in EBL:
   We will often do some commands in UEFI EBL shell for these methods, about how to enter it,
   please refer to UEFI_Manual.txt.

    1. IP address config (Optional, you can ignore this step if DHCP works well)
    the newest edk2 base code does not support the ifconfig command in "ebl", if we must set the IP address, we have to change to "shell" (EFI Internal Shell)
    # Config board's IP address
    ifconfig -s eth0 static <IP address> <mask> <gateway>
    e.g.: ifconfig -s eth0 static 192.168.1.4 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

    2. Download dtb file from FTP
    
    # Download file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <dtb file> -a <download target address>
    # Write data into FLASH
    spiwfmem <source address> <target address> <data length>
    e.g.: provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f hip06-d03.dtb -a 100000
          sfcerase 0x7C0000 0x10000
          sfcwrite 0x100000 0x7C0000 0x10000
    
    3. Reboot your D03 board

    You must reboot your D03 board after above two steps, this new DTB file will be used on booting board.

    Note: It is necessary to flash the DTB file to spiflash to solve a known MAC address duplicate Issue.
          Also it is to be noted that the DTB file should not be input in the Grub config file. So if you
          wish to use a modified DTB file, then you should always have it flashed to spiflash before bootup.

### Bring up System ###

There are several methods to bring up system, you can select following anyone fitting you to boot up.

# Boot via ESL

    In this boot mode, the kernel image, dtb file and rootfs file should be downloaded into RAM at first and then start the system by ESL.
    After reboot or power off, all downloaded data will be lost.
    This boot mode is just used for debugging.

    Boot D03 to UEFI SHELL, and type the follow commands in EBL:

    1. Download Image binary file from FTP server

    # Download Image binary file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <Image binary file> -a <download target address>
    e.g.: provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f Image_D03 -a 0x80000

    2. Download dtb file from FTP server

    # Download dtb file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <dtb file> -a <download target address>
    e.g.: provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f hip06-d03.dtb -a 0x06000000
    
    3. Download rootfs file from FTP server

    # Download rootfs file from FTP server to target board's RAM
    provision <server IP> -u <ftp user name> -p <ftp password> -f <rootfs file> -a <download target address>
    e.g.: provision 192.168.1.107 -u sch -p aaa -f mini-rootfs-arm64.cpio.gz -a 0x07000000
    
    4. Start operator system
    
    Type "exit" to exit EBL. Select "Boot Manager"->"ESL Start OS" menu to start operator system.

# Boot via PXE

    In this boot mode, the UEFI will get grub from PXE server.
    The grub will get the configuration file from TFTP service configured by PXE server.

    1. Setup PXE environment on host

    Enable both DHCP and TFTP services on one of your host machines according to Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.txt.

    2. Reboot and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI Boot Menu
    
    3. Select boot option "Boot Manager"->"EFI Network" boot option and press "Enter".
    
    4. After several seconds, D03 will boot by PXE automatically.
    
    To config the grub.cfg to support PXE boot, please refer to Grub_Manual.txt.

# Boot via NFS

    In this boot mode, the root parameter in grub.cfg menuentry will set to /dev/nfs and nfsroot will be set to the path of rootfs on NFS server.
    You can use "showmount -e <server ip address>" to list the exported NFS directories on the NFS server.

    D03 supports booting via NFS, you can try it as following steps:

    1. Enable DHCP, TFTP and NFS service according to Setup_PXE_Env_on_Host.txt.

    2. Get and config grub file to support NFS boot according to Grub_Manual.txt.

    3. Reboot D03 and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI Boot Menu

    4. Select boot option "Boot Manager"->"EFI Network" boot option to enter.

# Boot via DISK(SAS/USB/SATA)

    D03 board supports booting via SAS, USB and SATA by default. The UEFI will directly get the grub from the EFI system partition on the hard disk.
    The grub will load the grub configuration file from the EFI system partition. So grubaa64.efi, grub.cfg, Image and different estuary release 
    distributions are stored on disk.

    1. Boot by PXE (please refer to "# Boot via PXE") to part and format hardware disk before booting D03 board

      Format hardware disk, e.g.: sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1; sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
      Part hardware disk with "sudo fdisk /dev/sda" as follow:
        add a gpt to this disk : 
                            fdisk /dev/sda
                            g-------add a gpt partition
        add some EFI partition : 
                            n-------add a partition
                            1-------the number of partition
                            +200M---------size of partition
                            t-------change the type of partition
                            EFI system
        add some anther partition  ...
        save the change           : w
        formate EFI partition  : sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1
        formate ext4 partition : sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2

        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | Name    |   Size    |    Type      |   USB/SAS/SATA   | 
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | sda1    |   200M    |  EFI system  |   EFI            |
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | sda2    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | sda3    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | sda4    |   10G     |    ext4      | linux filesystem |
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
        | sda5    |rest space |    ext4      | linux swap       |
        +---------+-----------+--------------+------------------+
         Note: EFI partition must be a fat filesystem, so you should format sda1 with “sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1″.
　　
　　  2. Download files and store them into hardware disk as below.

        （SAS/USB/SATA）Related files are placed as follow:                                             
 
        sda1: -------EFI
              |       |
              |       GRUB2------grubaa64.efi  //grub binary file
              |
              |-------------grub.cfg           //grub config file
              |
              |-------------Image_D03          //kernel binary Image
        sda2: Ubuntu distribution
        sda3: Fedora distribution


       To get kernel image and dtb file, please refer to Readme.txt.
       To get and config grub and grub.cfg, please refer to Grub_Manual.txt.
       To get different distributions, please refer to Distributions_Guider.txt.                     
                                                                                                                                                                      
     3. Boot the board via SAS/USB/SATA 

      a. Modify grub config file(please refer to Grub_Manual.txt.4All)
         
          e.g.: the context of grub.cfg file is modified as follow:
	    #
	    # Sample GRUB configuration file
	    #
	    # Boot automatically after 5 secs.
	    set timeout=5
	    # By default, boot the Estuary with Ubuntu filesystem
	    set default=ubuntu
	    # For booting GNU/Linux

	    menuentry "ubuntu" --id ubuntu {
		set root=(hd0,gpt1)
		linux /Image rdinit=/init root=PARTUUID=XXX rootfstype=ext4 rw console=ttyS0,115200 earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0x80300000 ip=dhcp
	    }

	    Note:
	    1. XXX means the PARTUUID($blkid) of that partition which your linux distribution is located in. 
	    2. If you want to use another linux distribution, please refer above steps.

       b. Reboot and press anykey except "enter" to enter UEFI menu.

       c. Select "Boot Manager"-> "Boot Maintenance Manager"-> "Boot From File" boot option to select corresponding disk.
          Press arrow key up or down to select grub boot option to decide which distribution should boot.
      
# Boot via ACPI

   D03 also supports booting via ACPI, you can bring up this systerm which is
   similar with this DT mode, you must fix some point as follow:

   1. delete DTB file and don't burn DTB file

   2. Set the parameters of booting via ACPI
    you must add "acpi=force" property in "linux=...." line for "grub.cfg" file; while you delete DTB line
    for "grub.cfg" file.

	NOTE: you can get more information about setting grub.cfg from Grub_Manual.txt
