******  Estuary release 1.1 ******

These are the release notes for the Estuary version 1.1. Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to get, build, and run it.


1. Introduction 
=================

  Estuary is a development version of the whole software solution which target
  is the ICT market. It is a long term solution and focus on the combination
  of the high level components. And It is expected to be rebased from the
  newest version of the community quickly.


2. Components
================

- Toolchain
  This part is about the cross compiler for the arm platform. Now we directly
  use the binary downloaded from the Linaro. It is a tool to be used to
  compile the Linux kernel, boot loader and so on.

  URL: http://www.linaro.org/downloads/
  32bit gcc: http://releases.linaro.org/14.09/components/toolchain/binaries/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9-2014.09_linux.tar.xz
  64bit gcc: http://releases.linaro.org/14.09/components/toolchain/binaries/gcc-linaro-aarch64-linux-gnu-4.9-2014.09_linux.tar.xz

- UEFI
  This part is about the boot loader, now we use the UEFI as the bootloader. 
  The UEFI source code for D02 is not public currently, maybe we will publish
  it later, but now we can only provide binaries for D02.
  
  There is a "binary" directory in our project:
  https://github.com/hisilicon/estuary.git

  The source code for D01, you can get it by following commands:
  	$git clone http://git.linaro.org/git/uefi/linaro-edk2.git
  ...or
  	$git clone https://github.com/hisilicon/UEFI.git

- Grub
  This part is also about the boot loader. Grub can run in the UEFI, and
  supply some advanced function. We get the source code from the community.
  You can get it by following command:
  	$git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/grub.git

- Linux Kernel
  This part is about the OS kernel. Now we use the HULK (Huawei Unified Linux
  Kernel) which is the Linux Kernel maintained by the CSI and HTSAT together.
  it can support several SoCs, such as P650, P660, etc. 
  
  The latest avaible Kernel source code for estuary project is provided in
  following git repository by a branch named "estuary":
  github: https://github.com/hisilicon/linaro-kernel.git -b estuary  
  
  You can always get the latest version by following command:
	$git clone https://github.com/hisilicon/linaro-kernel.git -b estuary
  ...or get it with a special tag by following command:
	$git clone https://github.com/hislicon/linaro-kernel.git -b refs/tags/estuary-vx.x

- Distributions
  This part is about the rootfs of several distibutions (OpenEmbedded, Debian,
  Ubuntu, OpenSuse and Fedora). Now we directly use the binary. The
  OpenEmbedded is downloaded from the Linaro, and the else are downloaded from
  the respective offical website. 
  OpenEmbedded:
  http://releases.linaro.org/14.06/openembedded/aarch64/vexpress64-openembedded_minimal-armv8-gcc-4.8_20140623-668.img.gz
  Debian:
  http://people.debian.org/~wookey/bootstrap/rootfs/debian-unstable-arm64.tar.gz
  Ubuntu:
  http://snapshots.linaro.org/ubuntu/images/developer-arm64/latest/
  OpenSuse:
  http://download.opensuse.org/ports/aarch64/distribution/13.1/appliances/ 
  Fedora:
  http://dmarlin.fedorapeople.org/fedora-arm/aarch64/F21-20140407-foundation-v8.tar.xz

- QEMU
  This part is about the virtual platform. The QEMU (Quick EMUlater) can
  emulate the ARMv8 virtual machine on the x86 host machine, so we can use the
  virtual platform to do the validation of the common part for the whole
  software solution. We now get the source code from the community. You can get
  it by following command:
  	$git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git

3. Status
================

  In this version, the software solution are validated with the D01 boards,
  QEMU ARMv8 platform, the P660 EVB board and D02 board.
  Now the validated components are as following:
	- Toolchain
	- UEFI (only for D01)
	- UEFI\trust fw (only for D02)
	- GRUB2 (for D01, D02)
	- HULK
	- Distributions
	- QEMU


4. Fetching and Building
================
  How to fetch our whole solution and how to use it? This part will answer
  these questions.

 4.1 Preparation
  You need download repo by following commands:
	$mkdir -p ~/bin
	$curl "https://android.git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=tools/repo.git;a=blob_plain;f=repo;hb=refs/heads/stable" > ~/bin/repo
	$chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
	$echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
	$export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

 4.2 Fetch it
  Create a work directory by following commands:
	$mkdir workdir
	$cd workdir

  Download the whole project resource by following commands:
  	$repo init -u https://github.com/hisilicon/estuary.git -b estuary-v1.1 --no-repo-verify --repo-url=git://android.git.linaro.org/tools/repo
 	$repo sync
	If it fails during repo sync, you can just try to do 'repo sync' again.

  Continue to download the toolchains and a variety of distributions by:
	$./estuary/init.sh
	
 4.3 Build it
  Finally, build the estuary and run it on QEMU, D01, D02 or P660 EVB board. The
  build.sh is used to do it. 

  If want to read the help message, can type this commond:
  	$./estuary/build.sh -h
  
  Here is the example for running the OpenEmbedded with ARMv8 QEMU platform:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p QEMU -d OpenEmbedded

  Here is the example for building the software for D01 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D01 -d Ubuntu

  Here is the example for building the software for D02 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D02 -d Ubuntu

  Here is the example for building the software for P660 EVB board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p EVB -d OpenEmbedded

  Here is the example for building the software for P660 D02 board:
	$./estuary/build.sh -p D02 -d OpenEmbedded

5. Deployment
================
  How to deploy the system into our board, please refer to documents named "Deploy_on_the_xxx".

6. Contact us
================
  About the technical support, you can contact with chenxiang66@hisilicon.com.
