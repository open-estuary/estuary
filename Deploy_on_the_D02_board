***** Deploy on the D02 Board *****

1. Purpose
================

  This document describes how to build some files by Estuary tools v1.0, and
  also record the process of booting D02 board using those files.


2. Preparative
================

* Build FTP server in local host 

  We need to build FTP server in local host to communicate with P660 board
  whatever the system of local host is Windows or Ubuntu. For Ubuntu system it
  can download, compile and burn codes directly, but for Windows system it needs
  another server which is linux to compile source codes at first, and then
  transfer it to local host. 

  If local host system is Windows, what we should do is to set names and
  passwords of user, and directory of sharing files after installing software
  wftp32.  


3. Deploying
================
 
(1)	Get the whole project and initialize it according to chapter 4 of README. 

(2)	Run the scripts build.sh to build files we need 

	./tools/build.sh –p D02 –d OpenEmbedded 

	Note: D02 is the platform that can run those built files, and OpenEmbedded
          is the distribution which will run on D02 board.

	After that there is a folder named build on current directory, and a
	folder named D02 in build folder. Under the D02 folder there are file
	folders: distro, linux, toolchain, uefi. The distribution is under the
	distro, compiled source codes of kernel lay under the linux, cross-compiled
	toolchain is under the toolchain, PV660D02_B900_Release-0130.fd is under the ufei.  

(3) Burn the files into the D02 board and boot up

	Firstly, you should copy the files produced in the last part into the
	directory of the ftp sever. Then to burn these files, you can use the
	following commands.

	board configure
	---------------
	1. choose: 1:DDR 1600Mbps
	
	come into "burn menu"
	--------------------
	1. choose: [3] EBL
	
	Download dtb, kernel Image and rootfs into DDR RAM of P660 test board
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. ifconfig -s eth0 [IP.address] [mask] [gateway]
	2. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f hip05-d02.dtb -a 0x06000000
	3. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f Image -a 0x80000
	4. provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f filesystem.cpio.gz -a 0x07000000
	5. exit
	6. choose: [d] ESL Start OS to start kernel
	

	If you want to update the UEFI for the board, you can use following commands

	burn uefi:
	---------
	provision [server.IP] -u [name] -p [passwd] -f PV660D02_B900_Release.fd -a 100000
	spiwfmem 100000 0000000 200000

	more burn UEFI\trustfw information, please refer to ./build/D02/binary/readme after building your system.

	Note:
	The contents in the parentheses should be replaced according to the actual
	conditions.
